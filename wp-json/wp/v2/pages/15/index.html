It involves asking a question, finding relevant data, analyzing the data, visualizing it, and then writing an article that presents these findings.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Survey Write-up<\/strong>: HODP conducts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hodp.org\/surveys\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">its own surveys<\/a>, and the results are analyzed and presented in an article.

Give the reader an idea for what they&#8217;re in for, and why it&#8217;s important or relevant to them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The Data and Your Methods<\/strong>: Briefly discuss your data and where you got it from. If your data collection methods were complex, describe how you acquired your data. This section should be brief, but detailed enough to allow readers to trust your analysis.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The Insights<\/strong>: Present the results of your analysis both visually and numerically, and explain what each result means. Feel free to suggest hypotheses behind your results, but ensure everything you say is supported by data.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Unanswered Questions<\/strong>: It&#8217;s okay to acknowledge that the data doesn&#8217;t answer all your questions, or if your results are inconclusive.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Conclusion, Significance, Future Work<\/strong>: Synthesize your key results and connect them back to your original question. Discuss the significance of your work, potential future work, and why your work was interesting or important.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Check our our\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1XE6RhWkX6P2GFuK0w9lVYaWG0QiI55cU-hZZ04Ky73Y\/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fall 2020 bootcamp presentation<\/a>\u00a0on how to write an effective data journalism article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Publishing with HODP<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your article is written, refer to the style guide for information on what to submit to get published.
