This, along with other optimizations, makes Gatsby sites extremely fast.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sanity.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sanity<\/a>: A content management system (CMS) that stores website data for articles, blog posts, team members, datasets, and pages in structured JSON objects. Since Sanity is a headless CMS, it only controls the data, not the presentation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/graphql.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GraphQL<\/a>: A querying language used to retrieve data from Sanity in a predictable format.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/firebase.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Firebase<\/a>: A database that stores user data for the survey group and the predictions game.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/theme-ui.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Theme UI<\/a>: A styling framework that stores our style guide in one file. It handles sitewide themes, inline styles, and styled components.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Running the Site Locally<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To run the site on your local machine, you need to clone the website repository, navigate to the&nbsp;<code>hodp-website<\/code>&nbsp;directory, switch branches to&nbsp;<code>v2-styling<\/code>, install the dependencies, and run the site. The website will run locally at&nbsp;<code>localhost:8000<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Developing an Interactive Component<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The guide recommends developing your component in a separate repository before transferring it to the HODP codebase. It details the steps you need to follow to create a new component, test it, and add it as an option to the general ReactComponent type of block content. Once your changes are approved, they will be merged into the main branch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Troubleshooting<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you encounter errors, the guide provides tips on how to debug general issues and D3 development issues. You can reach out to the tech team if you need further assistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Codebase Outline<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<code>hodp-website<\/code>&nbsp;repo stores two websites. The&nbsp;<code>studio<\/code>&nbsp;directory controls the content structure and the frontend of the Sanity studio, while the&nbsp;<code>web<\/code>&nbsp;directory stores the code for the main website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, if you need to install node packages, install them in the&nbsp;<code>web<\/code>&nbsp;directory, not the general&nbsp;<code>hodp-website<\/code>&nbsp;directory. If you install them in the general directory, they\u2019ll work locally, but they won\u2019t be recognized in deployment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The HODP website is built using a diverse stack of technologies, and this guide will help you understand how to work with them.
